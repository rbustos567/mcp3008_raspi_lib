Setting up raspberry pi 3+ with the mcp3008 chip
------------------------------------------------

In order to read the analog inputs from the mcp3008 chip through the
raspberry pi we need to make some connections between these two.

Also, we will have to enable the SPI interface (linux driver) on the raspberry pi.

Steps
-----

Enabling the SPI interface
--------------------------

Execute the following commands:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo vi /boot/config.txt

Add the following line at the bottom of the file:

dtparam=spi=on

save the file and exit

and now reboot:

sudo shutdown -r now


Checking if SPI is enabled
--------------------------

use the following command:

lsmod | grep spi

Look for both:

spidev
spi_bcm2835 or spi_bcm2708

If you did not find these you might have to re-build the kernel
source code with the SPI options enabled, and then try again this two 
last steps.


Connecting raspberry pi 3+ with mcp3008 analog to digital converter
-------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need the mcp3008 chip, a breadboard and 6 female/male 
jumper wires.

The pin connections are shown here:

Raspberry pi            mcp3008 analog to digital converter
------------            ----------------------------------
PIN 1 (3v3)             PIN 16 (VDD) and PIN 15 (VREF) 
PIN 6 (Ground)          PIN 14 (AGND) and PIN 9 (DGND)
PIN 19 (GPIO 10-MOSI)   PIN 11 (DIN)
PIN 21 (GPIO 9-MISO)    PIN 12 (DOUT)
PIN 23 (GPIO 11-SCLK)   PIN 13 (CLK)
PIN 24 (GPIO 8-CE0)     PIN 10 (CS/SHDN)

Connecting a test analog input to the mcp3008 (Optional)
-------------------------------------------------------

Required:

- breadboard
- 10Kohms
- several male/male jumper wires

To test the reading of an analog signal I used a 
potenciometer of 10 KOhms.

Because it only has 3 pins you will need to find which one
is the VCC, GND and the output. Usually the stand alone pin
is the output and the other two (which are on the same side)
can be connected in any order to GND and VCC.

The connections are:

Potentiometer 10K        Raspberry pi
-----------------        ------------
VCC PIN                  PIN 1 (3v3)
GND PIN                  PIN 6 (Ground)                        


                         mcp3008 analog to digital
                         -------------------------
OUTPUT PIN               Any channel - from PIN 1(CH0) to PIN 8(CH7)



Using the mcp3008 library
-------------------------

Example: If you connected the potentiometer output to the analog 
channel 2 (PIN 3) and you would like to read the voltage of that single 
channel (single mode), you will have the call the following functions:

unsigned short ch = 2;
bool single_mode = true;
float out;
int ret;

// Initialize the lib
ret = init_mcp3008_device();

// Obtain the analog input from channel 2 in single mode
ret = get_volt_input_from_mcp3008_channel(ch, single_mode, &out);

printf("channel %d voltage = %f\n", ch, out);

// End the lib usage
ret = end_mcp3008_device();
