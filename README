Raspberry pi 3 C library for the MCP3008 ADC chip

This personal project is a quick solution for any raspberry pi 3 user who has a MCP3008 chip and wishes to 
read external analog signal.

As we know the raspberry pi 3 contains several gpios, however, none of these support analog signals. 
There are different ways to solve this problem, the easiest it consists in connecting a ADC to 
the gpios and configure them.

This C library provides the necessary functions to quickly start using your raspberry pi 3
to read any analog signal connected through the MCP3008.

To configure and setup the raspberry pi 3 with the MCP3008 read the SETUP file.

For installation and usage of the library read the file INSTALL.
