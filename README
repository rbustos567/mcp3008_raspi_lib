Raspberry pi 3 C library for the MCP3008 ADC chip

This personal project is a quick solution for any raspberry pi 3 user who has a MCP3008 chip and wishes to 
read external analog signal.

As we know the raspberry pi 3 contains several gpios, however, none of these support analog signals. 
There are different ways to solve this problem, the easiest it consists in connecting a ADC to 
the gpios and configure them.

This c library provides the neccesary functions to quickly start using your raspberry 
to read any analog values that are connected to the channels of the MCP3008.

To configure and setup the raspberry pi 3 with the MCP3008 read the SETUP file.

For installation and usage of the library read the file INSTALL.
